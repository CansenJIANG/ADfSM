## Important Information

Frame selection

The current implementation uses only the first 30 frames of your video clip. If you want to try with a different number of images or different sampling rate, please change 'sam_rate'.

Dense matching step

We implemented the function "DenseMatching" to receive a scale for image downsampling and the number of labels for your convenience in testing. (Default: 0.5 scale and 64 labels for quick tests, you can change them ('scaling, 'num_label')

For the depth refinement, we utilized a tree-based depth upsampling approach [1,2].
